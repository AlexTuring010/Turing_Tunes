# Turing Tunes

Turing Tunes is my first Android app, built as a learning project to help me prepare for an upcoming hackathon. Beyond just being a practice project, it's also something I personally wanted—a simple, **ad-free** music player with features I actually like.

## Why I Built This
1. **Learning Android Development** – Before my team and I participate in a hackathon, I wanted to practice Android development using **Kotlin** in Android Studio.
2. **A Music Player That Fits My Needs** – I listen to music a lot, and I found it frustrating that I couldn’t find a **simple** music player on the Play Store that wasn’t bloated with ads or missing key features.

## Features (Planned)
### **Phase 1: Basic Music Player** 🎵
- Play music **locally** from downloaded songs on your phone.
- Clean, minimal interface with essential playback controls.
- No ads, no unnecessary distractions.

### **Phase 2: YouTube Integration** 📺
- Add support for **streaming songs directly from YouTube**, making it easy to listen to tracks you don’t have downloaded.

### **Phase 3: AI-Powered Music Suggestions** 🤖🎶
- Give the "Turing" in Turing Tunes meaning by integrating **AI-powered music recommendations**.
- Users will be able to **type a description of how they feel**, and the AI will suggest a song that matches their mood.
- Discover new songs you **haven't heard before**.
- Save songs that you like for future listening.
- Option to choose recommendations from:
  - **Songs you've already listened to**
  - **Your own custom playlist**
  - **Completely new songs**
  - **A mix of both familiar and new music**

### **Future Possibilities** 🔮
- Allow users to provide **feedback** on how certain songs make them feel, improving AI recommendations.
- If the app gains a large user base, potentially develop a **custom AI model** trained on user preferences.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **IDE:** Android Studio
- **Frameworks:** Jetpack Compose (potentially), MediaPlayer API, Retrofit (for YouTube integration)
- **AI:** TBD (Could use OpenAI API or build a custom model in the future)

## Getting Started
This is still in development! Stay tuned for updates. 🚀
